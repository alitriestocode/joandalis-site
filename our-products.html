      <h2 id="line-relaxing" class="display-4">Line relaxing therapy</h2>
      <p class="lead">Line relaxing therapy by injection (also known as 'botox')</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>Everytime we laugh, smile or frown, we set off a series of contractions in the facial muscles. Over a period of time these contractions create creases in the skin which can make us appear worried, anxious and aged. Over a period of up to 2 weeks this simple, quick procedure will eliminate those tiresome lines leaving you looking refreshed and revitalised. The ideal result softens and relaxes the lines but still leaves some natural expression as the untreated muscles work normally.</p>
          <p>Although not currently licensed in the UK for all aesthetic treatments, line relaxing therapy by injection has been used safely and effectively since the early 1970's for this purpose, relaxing specific facial muscles that cause undesirable lines for instance the deep creases between the eyes, crows feet and forehead lines.</p>
          <p>The treatment works by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This prevents the nerve impulses telling the muscles to contract and thus the muscle remains relaxed. The effect is temporary, lasting 2-7 months, and is completely reversible.</p>
          <p>The treatment is administered via a number of injections using a very fine needle. Over a period of 3-5 days the effect gradually developes with the full effect at about 2 weeks. The maximal effect will vary in individuals depending on the initial depth of the lines, the size and strength of the underlying muscles and the amount used.</p>
          <p>Side effects of treatment are rare and usually mild. Immediately after treatment, there may be some mild swelling and redness but this usually settles very quickly - within a few hours. With any injection therapy, there is a slight risk of infection but this is uncommon. Bruising may occur at the site of the injection, especially if you are taking warfarin or aspirin at the time of treatment. Occasionally, clients may experience a temporary eyelid or eyebrow droop or lift which can be corrected or left alone as this usually resolves in a few weeks. Some experience a mild headache for a few days after treatment but tension headaches are usually improved.</p>
          <p>Your Practitioner will conduct a comprehensive assessment including a medical questionairre and provide you with post treatment advice. You will also be provided with a direct contact number for your Practitioner and be encouraged to contact them directly if you have any further questions or concerns.</p>
          <p>You should not undergo treatment if you are pregnant or breast feeding. There are certain special precautions and contraindications to the use of line relaxing treatment and these will be addressed using the medical questionairre.</p>
          <p>Alternative treatments for lines and wrinkles include dermal fillers, chemical peels, dermaroller, Obagi skin care treatments, laser treatments, surgical treatments or no treatment at all.</p>

        <p class="lead">Fill out the effects of time with Hyaluronic Acid injections</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p>If you are looking to enhance your looks with a natural long lasting result, this treatment is for you. Hyaluronic acid, a substance which occurs naturally in the body, is a crystal clear gel which constantly attracts water to it allowing skin hydration and moisturising from beneath the skin thus adding volume and contour to the facial skin. As we age, our own production of hyaluronic acid diminishes causing the skin to lose its volume and plumpness.</p>
            <p>Hyaluronic acid fills out the creases and folds of your skin without affecting your natural expression. It is non permanent and absorbed naturally over time - often the effects can last 9-12 months.</p>
            <p>The treatment takes under an hour and there is no requirement for skin testing prior to treatment. The results are seen instantly although the final result often takes a few more weeks.</p>
            <p>A number of injections will be required to the area to be treated. A topical anaesthetic cream applied prior to treatment will numb the area to be treated. As the lips are particularly sensitive, your Practitioner will discuss the option of an anaesthetic injection (a 'dental block')prior to lip enhancement.</p>
            <p>After treatment, some common injection related reactions may occur. These include redness, swelling, discomfort, itching and bruising over the site of the injections. All unwanted effects are usually transient - lasting a few days only. Occasionally, if you are prone to cold sores, treatment may precipitate an eruption - your Practitioner may advice the use of topical treatments as a preventative measure.</p>
            <p>Treatments to most lines cause very few noticable unwanted effects generally - any redness and swelling is usually mild and settles quickly. Lip enhancement however does often produce a few days 'downtime' as the lips may swell for 24-48 hours post treatment. Your Practitioner will help you plan your appointment to fit in with days off from work etc, allowing time for the initial effects to settle.</p>
            <p>Other reactions are fairly rare but include swelling and firmness at the site of the product. Redness, tenderness and rarely acne-like formations have been reported. These reactions have started from either a few days or few weeks post treatment and have been described as mild to moderate and self limiting with an average duration of 2 weeks.</p>
            <p>You will be provided with an after care advice and given contact details for your Practitioner should you have any questions or concerns.</p>
