          <h2>Line relaxing therapy by injection (also known as 'botox')</h2>
          <p>Everytime we laugh, smile or frown, we set off a series of contractions in the facial muscles. Over a period of time these contractions create creases in the skin which can make us appear worried, anxious and aged. Over a period of up to 2 weeks this simple, quick procedure will eliminate those tiresome lines leaving you looking refreshed and revitalised. The ideal result softens and relaxes the lines but still leaves some natural expression as the untreated muscles work normally.</p>
          <p>Although not currently licensed in the UK for all aesthetic treatments, line relaxing therapy by injection has been used safely and effectively since the early 1970's for this purpose, relaxing specific facial muscles that cause undesirable lines for instance the deep creases between the eyes, crows feet and forehead lines.</p>
          <p>The treatment works by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This prevents the nerve impulses telling the muscles to contract and thus the muscle remains relaxed. The effect is temporary, lasting 2-7 months, and is completely reversible.</p>
          <p>The treatment is administered via a number of injections using a very fine needle. Over a period of 3-5 days the effect gradually developes with the full effect at about 2 weeks. The maximal effect will vary in individuals depending on the initial depth of the lines, the size and strength of the underlying muscles and the amount used.</p>
          <p>Side effects of treatment are rare and usually mild. Immediately after treatment, there may be some mild swelling and redness but this usually settles very quickly - within a few hours. With any injection therapy, there is a slight risk of infection but this is uncommon. Bruising may occur at the site of the injection, especially if you are taking warfarin or aspirin at the time of treatment. Occasionally, clients may experience a temporary eyelid or eyebrow droop or lift which can be corrected or left alone as this usually resolves in a few weeks. Some experience a mild headache for a few days after treatment but tension headaches are usually improved.</p>
          <p>Your Practitioner will conduct a comprehensive assessment including a medical questionairre and provide you with post treatment advice. You will also be provided with a direct contact number for your Practitioner and be encouraged to contact them directly if you have any further questions or concerns.</p>
          <p>You should not undergo treatment if you are pregnant or breast feeding. There are certain special precautions and contraindications to the use of line relaxing treatment and these will be addressed using the medical questionairre.</p>
          <p>Alternative treatments for lines and wrinkles include dermal fillers, chemical peels, dermaroller, Obagi skin care treatments, laser treatments, surgical treatments or no treatment at all.</p>
